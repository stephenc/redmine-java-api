Release process for Redmine Java API.
-------------------------------------

Change version number in   \pom.xml
! Make sure it does not have "-SNAPSHOP" at the end.

Commit to SVN, wait for the new auto-build. Verify all tests pass.

Download 3 JAR files from the build server: src, classes, javadocs. E.g.:
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2-sources.jar
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2.jar
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2-javadoc.jar

Update version numbers (and maybe paths to the Jars) in "deploy_to_oss.cmd" script. 
Upload to Maven Central repository using the script.
You need to have the "SSH private key" on your machine for this(?).
You also need to provide a password for the upload, it's in "TA project infrastructure" doc
(not available to people who are not part of the project).

Drop the staging repository if something goes wrong:
Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories and "close" the 
Redmine Staging repository, then click "Release" to finalize.
The library will be synced from that repo to Maven Central in a few hours.
