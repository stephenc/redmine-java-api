Release process for Redmine Java API.
-------------------------------------

Change version number in  /pom.xml (make sure it does not have "-SNAPSHOT" at the end).
Commit to SVN.

AUTO-release:
Start this Jenkins job: https://ta-dev.dyndns.biz:8093/job/redmine-java-api-publish
This will build and test the library and then upload to OSS Sonatype Staging repository.

Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories and "close" the
Redmine Staging repository, then click "Release" to finalize.
The library will be synced from that repo to Maven Central in a few hours.

Hints:
1. the deployment passwords and GPG passphrase are stored on the build server in settings.xml file.
GPG key is stored on the build server as well.

2. Drop the staging repository if something goes wrong and re-start the Jenkins job or deploy via Maven script.

--------------SKIP THIS --------- MANUAL RELEASE (Not recommended)

Download 3 JAR files from the build server: src, classes, javadocs. E.g.:
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2-sources.jar
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2.jar
  redmine-java-api-1.5.2-javadoc.jar

Update version numbers (and maybe paths to the Jars) in "deploy_to_oss.cmd" script. 
Upload to Maven Central repository using the script.
You need to have the "SSH private key" on your machine for this(?).
You also need to provide a password for the upload, it's in "TA project infrastructure" doc
(not available to people who are not part of the project).
